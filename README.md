# Hello, World! üëã

I‚Äôm Shoshana Levitt, a full-stack software engineer based in New York City.

I have experience developing applications using the PERN stack and I specialize in front-end development. I graduated from The Grace Hopper Program at Fullstack Academy in February of 2023.

My background in account management and customer success has uniquely enriched my approach to software development. I believe that the most impactful products are not just about excellent code and design; they must be experiences crafted to resonate with users on a personal level.
